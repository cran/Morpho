    \item updated DESCRIPTION and README
    \item updated README added sourceforge and github download links

\section{Changes in Morpho version 0.25 (2013-07-24)}{
  \itemize{
    \item updated COPYRIGHT file
    \item simplified code in CVA and CVA.crova and finally mentioned Marta Rufino for providing all examples in docu for CVA (sorry Marta, I simply forgot)
    \item fixed issue when n-groups > n variables in CVA and CVA.crova
    \item replaced nn2 (RANN) with ann (yaImpute) because RANN got (temporarily) banned from CRAN because of violation of policy
    \item added readLandmarks.csv and docu to read landmarks stored in spreadsheet text files (e.g. comma separated)
    \item added check for empty groups in typprobClass and covW
    \item fixed some docu and added examples in pcaplot3d and rotonmat
    \item changed cube creation in deformGrid3d (much faster now).
    \item added options weights and centerweight in rotonmat
    \item added confirmation for plotting spheres in deformGrid when n > 1000 (can be slow)
    \item pcaplot3d now works if data has only 1 PC
    \item removed useless code remains 
    \item added docu for anonymize, r2morphoj, r2morphologika, NNshapeReg, kendalldist
    \item added bindArr to concatenate matrices/arrays
    \item switched from depends to import for colorRamps, MASS, RANN
    \item changed default core value in closemeshKD from detectCores() to 1.
    \item added option 'keep' in rmVertex 
    \item changed default method in meshDist.mesh3d from vcglib to morpho
    \item renamed regdist.raw to regdist and removed original regdist (too prone to user error)
  }
